- Dynamics, broad application of classical dynamics
- Disk dynamics 
- Early epochs - merger events
- Later epochs - evolution dominated by internal secular processes
- Interactions of stars with perturbations in the disk
- Emergence of dynamical chaos
- Theoretical look - isolate the particular parameters that influence kinematics for evolution of disks
- Cold torquing - major factor to disk structure

- Emergence of dynamical chaos
	- Analytic predictions
- Galactic dynamics

- Clumps of mass in the disk provide torque on stars in the disk
	- Unclear of general movement directions
	- Not known how the dispersion or flood inwards occurs or even if it occurs

- Metallicity tagging issues with mergers of galaxies

- Cold torquing 
	- Changing the size of the orbit, but not perturbing it
	- corotation - circular orbital frequency of the disk equals the spiral pattern speed
	- bounces between spiral arms 
	- spiral arms open up or dissipate - drops a star with angular momentum but no source of gravity?
- Kinematically cold orbit - organised circular orbit - birth of star
	- Orbit perturbations - rosettes - from other clumps
	- Kinemtically heated group of stars
	- Interaction via gravity with large clumps/clouds
