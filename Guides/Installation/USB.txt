Make the USB a bootable drive 
	- dd bs=4M if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress oflag=sync
	- Usually is sdb for USB
	- Check with lsblk -f
	
To restore the USB to usable condition - ie non bootable
	- Wipe the filesystem on the USB
	- wipefs -a /dev/sdX -> need to confirm this command
	- Remove the partitions and re-partition to a normal device
	- cfdisk /dev/sdX
	- Remove the partition and write a new partition
	- Use type FAT32, option b (or option c for larger devices)
	- Write to the device and quit
	- Make the vfat filesystem on the device
	- mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdX1
	- Command above will more than likely need root privileges
	- sudo mkfs -t vfat /dev/sdX1

USB should now be usable, and no longer a bootable drive
