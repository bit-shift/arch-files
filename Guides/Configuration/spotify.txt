Install the spotify package from the AUR repository
	- pakku -S spotify
	- Check build files 
	- Refer to i3 config for key bindings for volume and play/pause etc

Install the playerctl package for interface
	- pacman -S playerctl
	- Prevents having to use D-Bus
	- Refer to the i3 config file for the key bindings using playerctl
	- Far more simple commands

D-Bus configuration
	- Check the i3 config file for the commands used to talk to spotify using D-Bus
	- Will leave them commented when playerctl is implemented as a fallback
