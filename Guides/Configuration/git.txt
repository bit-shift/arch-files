Install the git package
	- pacman -S git 
	- Should already be installed during the installation process

Create a github account online 
	- Easy to sort out 

Install openssh package in order to use SSH
	- pacman -S openssh

Create an SSH key pair
	- ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "keegan.gyoery@gmail.com"
	- Press enter for file in which to save the key - default
	- Press enter again for no password on the SSH key

Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent
	- eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
	- ssh-add ~/.ssh/key_name (id_rsa is default)

Install the xclip package
	- pacman -S xclip
	- Used for copying stuff to the clipboard

Copy the SSH key to the clipboard
	- xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/key_name.pub (id_rsa.pub is default)

Add a new SSH key to the github account
	- Go to settings and then SSH Keys
	- Add new SSH key
	- Paste the SSH key into the input field
	- Title is Arch Linux
	- Add SSH key and enter password

Test that the SSH key pair is working

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Create the current directory as a git repository
	- git init
	- Create a new repository on github
	- Initialise with a README.md and .gitignore
	- Edit the .gitignore to ignore the correct files

Set up the current directory and now git repo to track to the remote repo
	- git remote add origin git@github.com:user_name/repo_name

Add the files to the repository
	- git add file_name ...
	- git commit -m "Message"

Set the repo to push upstream to the remote repo
	- git push -u origin master
	- Might need the username and password for the first time
	- After that, shouldn't need them again
	- Also, git push is the only command needed for push

Might be some other undocumented issues but this should be everything required
	- --allow-unrelated-histories flag for refusing to merge unrelated histories error
