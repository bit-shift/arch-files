Create the .profile file 
	- vim ~/.profile
	- Might need to make it a bash script, add the shebang and make executable
	- export EDITOR TERMINAL PATH
	- [ -f ~/.bashrc ] && source "$HOME/.bashrc"
	- [ "$(tty)" = "/dev/tty1" ] && ! pgrep -x i3 >/dev/null && exec startx
	- Starts the X server on login to tty1
	- Can switch to another tty which has no i3 and just bare arch using Alt+FX
	- Reads the .xintirc

Create the .bash_profile symlink
	- ln -sf .profile .bash_profile
	
Create the .bashrc file
	- It should already be created but will be used for aliases
	- Modify the PS1 variable to alter the prompt
	- Changes made were colours, and bold to symbols and spacing
	- Colours are of the format \[\033[COLORm\]
	- No colour is \[\033[00m\]
	- Bold is \[\033[01;COLORm\]
	- Remember to put no colour tag at the end of the configuration to prevent coloured text
	- Add in the aliases required for bash
	- alias name="commands"
	- Refer to .bashrc for the list of aliases added
