- Random freezes of the computer since 4.20 install and upgrade
- Firefox seemed ot be eating a lot of the CPU power

- Uninstalled and removed package
	- pacman -Rs firefox

- Installed chromium instead
	- pacman -S chromium

- Installed microcode to help with the boot process and stability of kernel
	- pacman -S intel-ucode
	- Configure grub to load the microcode updates and fixes
	- grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

- Installed memtester86+ to test RAM
	- pacman -S memtester86+
	- Reconfigure bootloader ie grub
	- grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
	- Reboot computer and select memtester86+ from grub menu
	- Run with F1 for no multi threading - 1.5 passes, no errors
	- Run with F2 for multi threading - < 0.5 passes, no errors, but freeze occurred again

- Current boot - 04/01/2019 ~8pm onwards with kernel parameters
	- Press e when at grub menu after rebooting
	- edit the linux .... line to add the parameters at the end
	- systemd.journald.forward_to_console=1 console=tty1
	- I might have forgotten the 1 after tty so it might not work if it crashes again yay
	- Deleted vimura script that was causing some dodgy stuff in terminal and I believe that crashes started after I wrote and ran it
	- Ran chromium with 20+ youtube videos at the same time and a cpu temp of 70+ and no issues so far
	- Potentially has solved the issue but don't want to get ahead of myself

- No issues or freezes since deleting vimura script

- Issue occurred again after trying to work outlook into mutt
- Removed the issue script from .mutt and will hopefully not incur the issue anymore
- No longer solved so reopened the log

- Another freeze occurred (idk how to spell occurred) when messing around with mpd, mpc, ncmpcpp

- Another freeze - not entirely sure what is causing these freezes yet
	- I think that they are hardware related not software
	- Will try run a boot with the kernel parameters tomorrow (10/01/19)

- Two freezes within the space of 5 minutes whilst searching for broken symlinks
	- Removed the broken symlinks and no issues
	- Multiple ls of other directories might have caused it, I have no clue really

- Freeze has occurred a one or two more times recently on 4.20
	- Just upgraded to 4.20.1 at 1700 on 14/01/19
	- Will see if further issues

- Uptime 5 days and counting since last freeze/power off - may have just been a power off or reboot not necessarily a freeze
	- Upgraded again to linux 4.20.3 at 1800 on 18/01/19
	- Still no issues
