Copying files from Mac via USB introduces heaps of .DS_Script and ._* files
	- Manually search through every directory to find these files and remove them
	- Inherent to Mac files and will always happen

Will write a c program to recursively search all directories and remove these files
	- Will run whenever a USB is mounted 
	- Will ideally work in conjunction with the USB mounting scripts

Wrote a hack job bash script to sort it out
	- Refer to ~/.scripts/tools/cleanmac
	- Run with -h for help list of commands 
	- Run once copied over to the home directory
	- Too dangerous to run in the root directory areas
