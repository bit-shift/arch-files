---------- [[ SOLVED ]] ----------

- Outer gaps pile on top of inner gaps so outer gaps are 30 not 15
	- Means that unless the outer gaps current set 0 command is issued, they remain at 30

- $mod+grave sets the i3 gaps to the correct size

- Issue solved by setting gaps inner 15 and gaps outer 0 at the start of the i3 config file
- Removed the temp fix by setting outer gaps 0 each time I moved to a different workspace
- Issue marked as solved but will keep the log
