Occasionally bash becomes very buggy and forgets what mode its in
	- Continues to display previous programs graphics or GUI
	- Forgets formatting and how it should behave
	- Biggest issue occurred with the vimura script that has already been deleted
	- Potentially need to reinstall everything and start from scratch

I think a big issue that needs to be addressed is the "buggyness" and freezes 
	- Refer to the freeze issue in another text file in this directory
	- I believe this can be rectified by reinstalling and starting it all from scratch
	- I think a lot of the install and config has left little scraps that were issues and some parts are scrappy and hodge podge
	- This is most likely from the trying to resolve issues and fix stuff with config and install for my system
	- As a result their might be a fair amount of garbage or broken files/config that is messing stuff up
	- A fresh install would resolve that for sure
	- So I think that the best thing is to power through this current install and config
	- Once I test this for the trimester and get it to a working state for uni, I will then look to upgrade
	- Transfer all files to github and to an external hard drive and upgrade laptop
	- Resell this laptop and the Macbook Pro

Potentially also install a disk sweeper to remove lint and garbage to make sure there are no issue files on the system
