shadow.service unit run by systemd failed on reboot, startup, and wake up from suspend
	- Trying to load mopidy and mpd groups
	- Results in a unit failure and a degraded system
	- Reloading failed units resolved the issues
	- susyr is my alias - refer to .bashrc for full command

Resolving the issue 
	- Remove the mopidy and mpd group from the /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files
	- sudo vim /etc/group
	- sudo vim /etc/gshadow
	- Remove all occurrences of mopidy and mpd as their own group and parts of other groups like the audio group
	- Issue resolved, and marked as solved

Issue returned with shadow.service failing again
	- Removed the mpd and mopidy users 
	- sudo userdel mpd
	- sudo userdel mopidy
	- Hopefully this removes the users and their home directories so shadow.service will no longer complain
