Installed compton and xcompmgr as well as, an alternative to compton
	- Was using for fade effects as its a composite manager
	- No matter the config run, would never close anything other than the last window open in a workspace correctly with a fade out
	- Even the opening of more windows wasn't the right fade in
	- Also caused screen tears instead of preventing them
	- Tried a bunch of settings with xrender backend and vysnc opengl
	- Nothing changed at all

My "solution" is just don't install compton or any other composite manager and just do without
	- i3-gaps doesn't support them officially anyways
