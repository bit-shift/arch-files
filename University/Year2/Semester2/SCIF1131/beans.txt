My bean has a small white ellipse on the along its equator, orientated horizontally.
Around the small white ellipse is a yellowish-brownish ring.
It has as small brown elliptical discolouration at the point of the bean, located again on the equator.
My bean has two red stripes running parallel from the end opposite to the brown discolouration to about halfway along the equator of the bean
At the same end as the stripes start, it also has a brown elliptical discolouration.
At both ends it has a similar brown discolouration, elliptical in shape.
It has antoher two stripes swirling out from the white ellipse discussed at the start.
These two swirls start at the end of the white ellipse opposite to the end that the parallel stripes begin from.
The opposite side to the swirls has very few markings and only a few red dots.
