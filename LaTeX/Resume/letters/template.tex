\textbf{2020 Summer Trading Internship Application September 28, 2019} \par
To Whom It May Concern, \par

I am writing to apply for IMC’s 2020 Trading Internship. I am in my fourth year of a
combined Advanced Mathematics and Computer Science degree at the University of New South
Wales. I have maintained a high distinction average throughout my studies and have been
included on the 2019 Dean’s Honours List with High Commendation for the School of Computer
Science. With a desire to apply my mathematical skill set to algorithmic trading, I believe I will
be an ideal candidate.\par

IMC is a world leading proprietary trading firm. Working collaboratively to attack complex problems in such a high performance environment is very appealing. I understand that this internship allows each individual to advance their knowledge of financial markets and trading analysis. As a mathematics student with strong quantitative skills, I believe I will thrive in such an environment. I am incredibly curious about financial markets and how I can apply my passion for numbers and problem solving in this competitive industry. Through this internship, IMC provides meaningful learning opportunities, and a chance to apply my skills to tackle tangible problems. I believe that my mathematics background allows me to learn and apply complex concepts effieciently. Further, the opportunity to work in a team with highly talented individuals is one of my main priorities. The chance to work collaboratively with like-minded individuals is a tantalising prospect.

Through my experience at the tutoring company, HSC CoWorks, I have learnt to work in a collaborative environment, particularly as a leader. The development of junior staff was my responsibility, and as such I have developed my communication and interpersonal skills. The role required the  ability to aid in the training of junior staff whilst maintaining a productive session for students. An important skill in any industry is being able to communicate technical jargon to those that are not experienced in your field. Through my development as a tutor I have become very successful at communicating complex mathematical topics to students that are only beginning to gain an understanding of high level mathematics. From my work at a small tech startup, I was able to gain an understanding of producing software to a customer standard, and an appreciation of the process of software development in a real scenario. I believe such skills would be sought after and beneficial as a trading intern at IMC.\par

IMC provides a challenging opportunity through which talented students can push themselves
and constantly learn in a collaborative environment. I would be pleased to be a part of it. \par

Warm regards, \par
