Refer to the Guides directory for the written guides under the sub-directories Installation, Configuration and Issues.

## Guides
### Installation
Contains the Installation.txt and After-Install.txt files. The Installation.txt file contains the process required to install Arch Linux from a bootable device and have a working bare-bones operating system. The After-Install.txt details the steps taken to add basic functionality on top of the basic installation. Simple things like ensuring network setup is finalised, and configuring sudo privileges.

### Configuration
Contains all the files detailing how to configure packages I have installed on Arch. Each file considers the installation process, the configuration steps, any problems encountered and their requisite solutions, and finally provides the actual Linux commands used, every single one. The packages.txt file contains a variety of packages that only required install, and possibly some basic configuration, and did not warrant a separate file.

### Issues
This directory contains files of issues encountered whilst setting up and configuring the system. Those that are solved have the word solved in the file name, and each file chronicles the steps taken to solve the issue, or as much information about the unresolved issue as possible.
